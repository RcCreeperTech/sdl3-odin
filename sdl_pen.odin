// # CategoryPen
//
// SDL pen event handling.
//
// SDL provides an API for pressure-sensitive pen (stylus and/or eraser)
// handling, e.g., for input and drawing tablets or suitably equipped mobile /
// tablet devices.
//
// To get started with pens, simply handle EVENT_PEN_* events. When a pen
// starts providing input, SDL will assign it a unique PenID, which will
// remain for the life of the process, as long as the pen stays connected.
//
// Pens may provide more than simple touch input; they might have other axes,
// such as pressure, tilt, rotation, etc.

// SDL pen instance IDs.

// Zero is used to signify an invalid/null device.
//
// These show up in pen events when SDL sees input from them. They remain
// consistent as long as SDL can recognize a tool to be the same pen; but if a
// pen physically leaves the area and returns, it might get a new ID.

// Pen axis indices.
//
// These are the valid values for the `axis` field in PenAxisEvent. All
// axes are either normalised to 0..1 or report a (positive or negative) angle
// in degrees, with 0.0 representing the centre. Not all pens/backends support
// all axes: unsupported axes are always zero.
//
// To convert angles for tilt and rotation into vector representation, use
// sinf on the XTILT, YTILT, or ROTATION component, for example:
//
// `sinf(xtilt * PI_F / 180.0)`.
